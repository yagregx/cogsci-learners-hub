# Cognitive Science Learner's Hub
## Dear Hi
Hello there!

This repository is an online database for learners of cognitive science to collect &amp; share resources. 

Cognitive science is interdiscilinary in its nature. Anyone might know more in a field than others. This is a platform where you can drop what you got, and learn from those who specialized in fields other than yours!

The database is intended to benefit all learners, though some of the content may be especially relevant to high school &amp; undergraduate students. These content will be labeled with targeted level.

This is a project still under construction. Contributions are super welcome! 



## What is CogSci? ‚öôÔ∏è


Cognitive science is the scientific study of mind. Its indisciplinary nature encourages people from different academic background to collaborate and contribute to its advancement.

The resources in this repository is currently grouped according to subject fields. Specifc resources may appear under several subject fields if their content is relevant to more than one (they usually are).

|Group|Subjects Included|
|---|---|
|General CogSci|Interdisciplinary content relevant to multiple subjects|
|The Hexagon*|Psychology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, Anthropology|
|Connected Subjects|Education, Gender Studies, Interactive Design|
|Supporting Subjects|Mathematics, Programing|

* The Hexagon is a founding idea of the structure of CogSci originally proposed in 1978. See: Keyser, S.J., Miller, G.A., and Walker, E.: Cognitive Science in 1978. An unpublished report submitted to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, New York (1978).

## Psychology
Psychology is...the study of the mind and behavior. 

Historically, psychology was an area within philosophy and emerged from it (see epistemology). It is now a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research (e.g., experimental, biological, cognitive, lifespan developmental, personality, social), as well as several subareas of research and applied psychology (e.g., clinical, industrial/organizational, school and educational, human factors, health, neuropsychology, cross-cultural). Research in psychology involves observation, experimentation, testing, and analysis to explore the biological, cognitive, emotional, personal, and social processes or stimuli underlying human and animal behavior. The practice of psychology involves the use of psychological knowledge for any of several purposes: to understand and treat mental, emotional, physical, and social dysfunction; to understand and enhance behavior in various settings of human activity (e.g., school, workplace, courtroom, sports arena, battlefield); and to improve machine and building design for human use.
