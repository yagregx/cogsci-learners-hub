# Cognitive Science Learner's Hub
## Dear Hi
Hello there!

This repository is an online database for learners of cognitive science to collect &amp; share resources. 

Cognitive science is interdiscilinary in its nature. Anyone might know more in a field than others. This is a platform where you can drop what you got, and learn from those who specialized in fields other than yours!

The database is intended to benefit all learners, though some of the content may be especially relevant to high school &amp; undergraduate students. These content will be labeled with targeted level.

This is a project still under construction. Contributions are super welcome! 

WE ALL LOVE COGSCI.

## What is CogSci? 

**First and foremost: COGS** ‚öôÔ∏è

Cognitive science is the scientific study of mind. Its indisciplinary nature encourages people from different academic background to collaborate and contribute to its advancement.

The resources in this repository is currently grouped according to subject fields. Specifc resources may appear under several subject fields if their content is relevant to more than one.

|Group|Subjects Included|
|---|---|
|General CogSci|Interdisciplinary content relevant to multiple subjects|
|The Hexagon*|Psychology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience, Anthropology|
|Connected Subjects|Education, Gender Studies, Interactive Design|
|Supporting Subjects|Mathematics, Programing|

* The Hexagon is a founding idea of the structure of CogSci originally proposed in 1978. See: Keyser, S.J., Miller, G.A., and Walker, E.: Cognitive Science in 1978. An unpublished report submitted to the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, New York (1978).
